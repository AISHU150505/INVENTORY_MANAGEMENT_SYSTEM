Inventory Management System (IMS) - College Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Inventory Management System (IMS), a project developed as part of my college curriculum. This system is specifically designed to empower small businesses with a robust and intuitive inventory management tool, helping them streamline operations, reduce waste, and boost efficiency.

üåü Project Overview
This IMS is crafted to tackle the conventional challenges of inventory management faced by small businesses. With an emphasis on user-friendly design and efficient resource management, the system ensures that small businesses can maintain optimal stock levels, manage resources efficiently, and keep their operations running smoothly without the complexities typically associated with inventory management.

Secure Access Controls: Different access levels for admins and users to ensure data security and integrity.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The project is built using popular and time-tested web technologies:
